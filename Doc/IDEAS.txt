make a maze that descends into hell
each level is closer to hell
maze is generated randomly
first level : skybox, open sky
scary theme
random updrades (like binding of isaac)
enemies on each lvl
player health, if he dies, consequences (ex : go back a lvl higher)
when player gets overwhelmed, 5 charges per lvl to regenerate entire lvl randomly
as the player walks through the maze, he reveals where he has passed on his map
mini bosses at random place in lvl, big boss at the end
theme for each lvl (darker as you get lower to hell)
random teleports from one place to another in the map
